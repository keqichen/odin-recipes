    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>6 egg yolks</li>
                <li>1 cup white sugar, divided</li>
                <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese</li>
                <li>6 egg whites, stiffly beaten</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons kirschwasser</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups strong brewed coffee, cold</li>
                <li>25 ladyfingers</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl beat together the egg yolks and 1/3 cup of sugar. Using a wooden spoon stir in mascarpone cheese, beaten egg whites, cream and kirschwasser; stir until smooth. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Dissolve remaining 2/3 cup sugar in coffee. Quickly, to avoid complete saturation, dip ends of ladyfingers in coffee mixture. Place ladyfingers in a single layer in a 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish. Spread a layer of cheese mixture over the ladyfingers; repeat layers, ending with cheese mixture.</li>
                <li>Cover and refrigerate for several hours. Sprinkle with cocoa just before serving.</li>
            </ol>
