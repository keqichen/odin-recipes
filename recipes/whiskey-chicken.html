        <img src="../img/chicken.jpeg" alt="A picture of wiskey chicken" width="600" length="800">
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A quick whiskey chicken that has so many uses, whether by itself, over rice, or in pasta. 
            A great dinner or lunch meal. 
            Again it's best to BBQ the chicken, and you can remove the garlic cloves if desired; they are only there to infuse flavor into the sauce.
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds chicken thighs</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups pineapple juice</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons bourbon whiskey, or more to taste</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons butter, or to taste</li>
                <li>2 large mushrooms, sliced</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                <li>Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Cook the chicken thighs until no longer pink in the center and somewhat charred on the outside, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Let chicken cool until able to handle easily, cut into strips, and put into a large glass bowl.</li>
                <li>Stir pineapple juice, bourbon whiskey, soy sauce, garlic cloves, brown sugar, and black pepper together in a saucepan over medium-low heat; stir until the sugar dissolves, bring to a simmer, and cook until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the sauce simmers, melt the butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms in hot butter until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir into the simmering sauce.</li>
                <li>Pour the mushrooms and sauce over the chicken strips and toss to coat.</li>
            </ol>
